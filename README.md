# Blender-Tablet-Mode
A Tablet Mode for Blender which should also work for touchscreens, improving usability within several editors.
Currently a Proof-of-Concept only!

Programming Language: Python 3.4.2

This Add-on should allow you to work with graphics tablets and touchscreens more intuitivly and effectivly, nevertheless the normal mouse behavior should not be affected.
At this moment, Blender can be used with a graphics tablet, but it conflicts with right click select and some other characteristics of Blender.

The basic idea:
The user can simply tap on a object or node to select it, and if he then moves the pencil/the finger, this object or node moves along it.
